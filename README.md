# P-Net-MINIAOD-Pre-Processing
This repository contains a set of CMSSW modules and helper scripts designed to preprocess particle physics data (specifically from MINIAOD files) into flat `TTree` ROOT files. The resulting files are optimized for subsequent analysis, particularly for training machine learning models. The framework is configured to handle both AK8 and AK15 jets.
